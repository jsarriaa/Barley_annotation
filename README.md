# Barley_annotation
De novo annotation of a barley landrace, part of my PhD

We sequenced and ensambled a new Barley landrace originary from Iraq. We follow the same protocols and pipelines as the Pangenome V2 of  (reference), actually in colaboration with IPK groups in charge of sequencing (reference) and ensambling (reference) it.
Following the most comparable approach, de novo annotation has been reported, following the pantranscriptome pipeline. Acknoledgment to Manuel Spannagle (ocomoseescriba) but specially to our collaborator Thomas Lux.

For this, we own 5 tissues 3 replicates of mRNA-seq and IsoSeq from a pool of root and shoot, performed by the company BMK-GENE.
Raw data is free to access at ENA: (Links)
